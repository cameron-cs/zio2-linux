# zio2-linux
This project provides a ZIO-based wrapper for Linux I/O and memory management functions using the Java Native Access (JNA) library. The project includes functionality for memory allocation, I/O operations, and various system-level tasks, making it easier to interact with low-level system calls in a type-safe and functional way using ZIO.
